*************************************************************************************************
*This conclusion includes findings from running the extra-credit algorithm - Kadane's algorithm -
*
*In the above table, the time derived is in nanoseconds, and we found that the brute force method is the least-performing algorithm to solve the maximum subarray problem. Divide and conquer and Kadane's algorithms are notably more efficient than Brute Force.
*This difference becomes more evident when repeating the same test of all three methods on the same array, especially as the size of the array increases.
*For example, if we consider an array with size 1000, In Bruteforce calculates the max subarray sum in 9156500 nanoseconds, Divide and Conquer solves the same problem in 15543700 nanoseconds, and Kadane outpaces the previous two algorithms performing the same operation in 472800 nanoseconds
*This information shows that on small-scale arrays, Kadane's algorithm is the best-performing one, followed by Bruteforce and Divide and Conquer. Comparing the first with the subsequent algorithms' digits, we count five digits for Kadane's speed, seven digits for Bruteforce, and 8 digits for Divide and Conquer.
*Upon repeating the speed test on an array with size 10000, we learned that Kadane leads again in solving the max subarray problem with a speed of 3056999 nanoseconds (7 digits), followed by Divide and Conquer and Bruteforce with 10484151 nanoseconds (8 digits) and 83424308 nanoseconds (8 digits) respectively.
*Increasing the array size to 80000, we confirm that Kadane still outpaces all the other algorithms, solving the max subarray problem in 22514509 nanoseconds (8 digits), followed by Divide and Conquer with a speed of 2239965316 nanoseconds (10 digits) and Bruteforce with pace of 2240908273 nanoseconds (10 digits).
*The time complexity for finding the maximum subarray using the brute force method is O(N^2) whereas the time complexity of Divide and Conquer and Kadane's algorithms are O(NLog(N)) and O(n), respectively. Using Big-O notation, we hope to convey why Kadane outperforms all three methods.
*The reason why Bruteforce lags behind Divide and Conquer, and Kadane's algorithm is because it involves iterating through all possible subarrays of a given array and calculating their sums, additional steps that inevitably slow down the algorithm's execution.
*However, the same cannot be said about Divide and Conquer despite edging Bruteforce's number of digits in execution speed. This algorithm's approach recursively halves the array and finds the maximum subarray sums to ultimately combine them.
*Kadane's algorithm offers an optimized approach to solving the maximum subarray problem with a sequential one-time analysis of each index through the entire array. At each index, it compares its maximum sum variable with its current sum variable, updating the latter sequentially or updating the former whenever the current sum exceeds it.
*Because of Kadane's dynamic approach to the problem, we conclude that it is the best-performing algorithm out of the three, regardless of the array' size.
